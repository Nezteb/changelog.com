# Docker Engine on Fly.io

This is a Docker Engine that runs on Fly.io.
It is **only** used for [thechangelog/changelog.com](https://github.com/thechangelog/changelog.com) builds.
It provides built-in caching & better performance than the free GitHub Actions Runners (4 CPUs vs 2 CPUs).


## Deploy

1. Create a new app: `fly apps create docker-2022-06-13`
1. Create a volume in a region of your choice: `fly volumes create data --size 50 --region iad`
1. Deploy app: `fly deploy`


## Test

1. Create a WireGuard peer: `fly wireguard create changelog iad github-actions-2022-06-13`
1. [Setup WireGuard with generated config](https://fly.io/docs/reference/private-networking/#importing-your-tunnel)
1. Get the Docker Engine private IP: `fly ips private` â†’ `fdaa:0:4556:a7b:21e0:1:1f9d:2`
1. Set the `DOCKER_HOST` env variable:
    ```sh
    export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://[fdaa:0:4556:a7b:21e0:1:1f9d:2]:2375
    ```
1. Ensure that you can connect to this Docker Engine:
    ```sh
    docker info

    Client:
     ...

    Server:
     ...
     Server Version: 20.10.17
     Kernel Version: 5.12.2
     Operating System: Alpine Linux v3.16
     Architecture: x86_64
     CPUs: 1
     Total Memory: 221.2MiB
     Docker Root Dir: /data/docker

    WARNING: API is accessible on http://[::]:2375 without encryption.
             Access to the remote API is equivalent to root access on the host. Refer
             to the 'Docker daemon attack surface' section in the documentation for
             more information: https://docs.docker.com/go/attack-surface/
    ```


## Scale

We want to scale this remote Docker Engine to a size which is more appropriate for compiling Erlang code: `fly scale vm dedicated-cpu-4x`

The above VM size takes `5m 25s` to complete a build with no cache. The default VM size takes ~3x as long.

Other VM sizes available: https://fly.io/docs/about/pricing/


## Use

This new Docker Engine is configured & used in `.github/workflows/prod_image.yml`

## Troubleshooting

### What should I do if the Wireguard tunnel stops working in GitHub Actions?

1. Create a new WireGuard peer:
    ```sh
    pwd
    $HOME/github.com/thechangelog/changelog.com/2022.fly/docker

    fly wireguard create changelog iad github-actions-2022-08-30

    !!!! WARNING: Output includes private key. Private keys cannot be recovered !!!!
    !!!! after creating the peer; if you lose the key, you'll need to remove    !!!!
    !!!! and re-add the peering connection.                                     !!!!
    ? Filename to store WireGuard configuration in, or 'stdout':  stdout

    [Interface]
    # ... omitting for security reasons
    PersistentKeepalive = 15
    ```
1. Update the [`FLY_WIREGUARD` value in GitHub Actions secrets](https://github.com/thechangelog/changelog.com/settings/secrets/actions) with the stdout output, starting with the `[Interface]` line
1. Re-run the failed job, e.g. https://github.com/thechangelog/changelog.com/actions/runs/2951152698
